# Attacks-on-RSA

RSA is the fundamental part of various security protocols for communication over the internet. Despite the fact that RSA would break once quantum computing becomes scalable, it is still widely used. Hence, it is importnat to figure out potential ways RSA could fail to guarantee security. This project starts off by discussing the mechanics of RSA and then dives into possible attacks on the cryptosystem. The project also contains Python code which implements each of the attacks mentioned in the paper.
